Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  At Global Rain, you are tasked with working with a client, Artemis Financial. Your client is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. As an important step in Artemis Financial’s desire to modernize its operations and as a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect their client data and financial information. Specifically, Artemis Financial is seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. You have been asked to take their current software application and add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements. You will deliver a production quality integrated application that includes secure coding protocols.
  
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  Something that I did particularly well in identyfying their software security vulnerabilities was I determined what vulnerabilties were false positives and what vulnerabilties were actual issues that needed resolution. In addition to identifying vulnerabilties that were a concern I also was able to find common solutions to rememdy them. It is important to code securely because whenever you dont code with security in mind there is a higher chance to introduce other issues into a project. Keeping secure coding in mind can help reduce how many problems are introduced and can make finding the problems and their solutions a lot easier of a process. Software Security adds value in the form of peace of mind that you know that your data and interactions are being kept safe and secure. Ensuring that you can keep customer information safe is a huge part of having a successful business and keeping the trust of your users. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

  The part of the process where you have to try to find solutions to some of the problems that come up can be a challenge. When going through the CVE and looking at records they can often be a bit of a maze but once you find a general fix for the issue it is easy to identify. For example you may have to sift through some email threads before you find that updating to the current version of spring-boot solves a particular security concern. This process can take a while depending on how many vulnerabilities there are and in most cases fixing one can fix many but the process itself is still very manual.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
